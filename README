Synopsis: an open source project to provide a conversion tracking 
          solution for iOS without the use of Unique Device Identifier (UDID)

Usage:
 #include "CWorks.h"
  
  //record click
  [CWorks recordClick:@"testapp" forAdNetwork:@"drawbridge" uniqueId:@"testid"];
  
  //record Impression
  [CWorks recordImpression:@"testapp" forAdNetwork:@"drawbridge" uniqueId:@"testid"];

  //get list of clicks. All clicks for this app are deleted once accessed.
  NSDictionary * dict = [CWorks getClicks:@"testapp"];

  //get list of Impressions. All impressions for this app are deleted once accessed.
  NSDictionary * dict = [CWorks getImpressions:@"testapp"];

  Check for nil dictionary objects when getting the records. Data returned by get functions is in the following
  format,
  
  type.networkName.uniqueId  ==> timestamp (UTC in milliseconds)
  
  where type is the either "i" for impression or "c" for click. network name and unique id is the same as 
  passed by the ad network.
  
  
  Default number of impressions or clicks stored in the pasteboard for a given app is 50. Please change
  the parameter kMaxPasteBoardItems present in CWorks.m to suitable number for your implementation if needed.
  
  
Context:

Conversion tracking is a crucial component of any performance based advertising solution. Mobile ad networks, supply and demand 
side platforms have traditionally adopted a conversion tracking approach based on the UDID on iOS. With Apple recently taking a 
position against the use of the UDID and deprecating access to the same, there is a need for an innovative, privacy friendly solution. 

Additionally developers who use multiple channels for advertising and solving their user acquisition needs, stand to benefit tremendously 
from a transparent, open and privacy friendly standard for conversion tracking. This open source initiative addresses a real need in the 
ecosystem around a fair standard for attributing conversions to the rightful driver, obviating duplicate claims. 

As proprietary solutions around device identification emerge it could lead to fragmentation and hence creating challenges for a unified 
conversion tracking solution. This project is an open source initiative to solve this problem for many developers and continue to make it 
a thriving and efficient ecosystem.
